# DALI Challenge 2
## Henry Foster

### index.html & .js 
```
I used the API plot.ly to create the Map Graph. 
The two standard checkboxes trigger a filtering 
function in JS which takes the master JSON array 
of people and filters out those that don't match the checkboxes. 
```

### bio.html & .js
```
When a datapoint is clicked on index.html, 
the JS saves the JSON object in localStorage. 
The JS then redirects to bio.html and from the 
local storage loads and populated the bio page with the persons information. 
```
### Problems
```
The index.html does not look the most impressive. However, I decided to sacrifice visuals on the main page with functionality and used a straightfoward and visually simply API known as Plot.ly.
